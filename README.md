## Script Details

**Dependencies:** `PIL` for image handling, `os` for file management, `shutil` for file transfer, and `defusedxml` to prevent any potentially malicious operation.

**Functionality:**

- The script scans the specified folder for JPEG images.
- It checks each image's metadata for a 5-star rating.
- If a 5-star JPEG is found, the script locates its RAW counterpart.
- The RAW images are then copied to the designated output folder.
